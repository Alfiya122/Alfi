Here is a repository description for the Wisecow project on GitHub:

---

### Wisecow Application

This repository contains the Wisecow application, containerized and deployed on a Kubernetes environment with secure TLS communication, and automated using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD).

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to containerize the Wisecow application and deploy it on Kubernetes, ensuring secure TLS communication and automating the deployment process using GitHub Actions.

#### Repository Structure
- `app.py`: The main application code.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the Wisecow application.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image of the Wisecow application.
- `deployment.yaml`: Kubernetes manifest file for deploying the Wisecow application.
- `service.yaml`: Kubernetes manifest file for exposing the Wisecow application as a service.
- `ingress.yaml`: Kubernetes manifest file for securing the application with TLS using Cert-Manager and Let's Encrypt.
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for automating the build, push, and deployment of the Wisecow application.

#### Features
- **Dockerization**: The application is containerized using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests are provided to deploy the application.
- **TLS Communication**: The application is secured with TLS using Cert-Manager and Let's Encrypt.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow automates the build and deployment process.

#### How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nyrahul/wisecow.git
    cd wisecow
    ```

2. **Build and Run Docker Container**:
    ```sh
    docker build -t wisecow-app .
    docker run -p 4000:80 wisecow-app
    ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
    ```

4. **Configure CI/CD**:
    - Set up GitHub secrets for Docker Hub credentials and Kubernetes config:
        - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`
        - `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
        - `KUBE_CONFIG_DATA`

    - Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

#### End Goal
The successful containerization and deployment of the Wisecow application to a Kubernetes environment with an automated CI/CD pipeline, secured with TLS communication.
